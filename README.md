<b> I am Ahmed Alshenoudy, a Master's degree student at Johannes Kepler University in Linz and an AI Software Developer at RISC GmbH. </b>
<br />
<br />
I thrive to learn and educate myself, I am on a <i> continuous learning journey </i> where I always look for personal and professional growth. Currently I am finalizing my master's thesis project and studies, where I am expecting to <i> graduate </i> in the 2022-2023 winter semester. I am interested in being part of a team where I get to apply my knowledge, challenge myself and grow, while working on innovative projects that applies machine learning or deep learning to real life problems.
