<br />
I thrive to learn and educate myself, I am on a <i> continuous learning journey </i> where I always look for personal and professional growth. Currently I am finalizing my master's thesis project and studies, where I am expecting to <i> graduate </i> in the 2022-2023 winter semester. I am interested in being part of a team where I get to apply my knowledge, challenge myself and grow, while working on innovative projects that applies machine learning or deep learning to real life challenges.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>
As I am finalizing my studies, most of my time is currently dedicated to my thesis project, in this project I am working on exploiting learned representations from state of the art generative models (diffusion models) for the down-stream task of semantic segmentation applied to a 2D dataset extracted from the BraTs 2021 training data.
